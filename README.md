## Android Poker Game Appplication

The primary objective of the application is to help new players learn how to play the game and, more importantly, how to improve. Note that our game can also be very helpful to more experienced players to step up their game! With this in mind, we had no other choice than to bring up statistics in a way that the user could visually see them and interpret them easily. In fact, we created a unique probability table to deliver the most important statistics so that the user can make the most informed decisions at any time while playing.

In our singleplayer game, you will face three other bots. Using probability and statistics, they are able to evaluate the strenght of their hands and also bluff other players.
